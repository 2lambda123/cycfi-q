Everywhere in this documentation, we will be using a namespace alias to make the code less verbose: namespace q = cycfi::q; In the world of electronic music, there are processors and synthesizers, the definitions of which are somewhat overlapping and differ only on one specific point: that processors take in one or more input value(s) and produces one or more output value(s), whereas a synthesizer does not take in any inputs at all. In the Q world, both processors and synthesizers are just functors —C function objects, which are basic building blocks that can be composed to form more complex functions. A functor can have zero or more input values and produces one or more output values (typically just one, but in certain cases, two or more output values may be returned in the form of C tuples). Syntactically, you use these just like any other function. So, for instance, for a single input functor: float r = f(s); where s is the input value, and f(s) returns a result and stores it in the variable r. Typical audio processor functors in the Q DSP library work on 32-bit float input samples with the normal -1.0 to 1.0 range. Values are not restricted to sampled signals, however. For an example, signal envelopes are best represented in the decibel domain, and so dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders take decibel as inputs and return decibel results. For example: decibel gain = comp(env); Another example, oscillators work on phase-angle inputs and return output samples: float out = sin(phase++); The Q DSP library has a rich set of such types: float: Typical sample data type -1.0 to 1.0 (or beyond for some computational headroom). frequency: Cycles per second (Hz). duration : A time span (seconds, milliseconds, etc.) period : The inverse of frequency phase: Fixed point 1.31 format where 31 bits are fractional. phase represents 0 to 2π phase values suitable for oscillators. decibel: Ratio of one value to another on a logarithmic scale (dB) The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe. You can not mismatch values of different types such as frequency and decibel, for example. Such potentially disastrous mistakes can happen if all values are just raw floating point types. Values do not have implicit conversion to raw types, however, except for decibel, which is special because it operates on the logarithmic domain, comparison and arithmetic with raw types are possible. For example: auto harmonic = 440_Hz * 4; // 440_Hz is a frequency literal (see below) To augment the wealth of value types, the Q DSP library makes abundant use of C++ user-defined literals. Here are some examples: auto c4 = 261.6256_Hz; auto threshold = -36_dB; auto coef = 1.0 - (2_pi * 1_kHz / sps); auto attack = 20_ms; To use these literals, include the literals.hpp header: #include then use the literals namespace somewhere in a scope where you need it: using namespace q::literals; Here’s the list of available literals: // frequency constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(unsigned long long int val); // duration constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(unsigned long long int val); // decibel constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(unsigned long long int val); constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(long double val); // pi constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(long double val); constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(unsigned long long int val) There is also a complete set of tables for notes from A[0] (27.5Hz) to Ab[9] (13289.75Hz).

In the future, it is possible to make use additional libraries, as long as the libraries depended upon are also self-contained. q_lib is a no-frills, lightweight, header-only library. q_io: Audio and MIDI I/O layer, with very minimal dependencies (portaudio and portmidi) and very loose coupling via thin wrappers that are easy to transplant and port to a host, with or without an operating system, such as an audio plugin or direct to hardware ADC and DAC. By design, communication to and from the application, including but not limited to parameter control, is done exclusively via MIDI. We will track the development of the forthcoming (as of January 2019) MIDI 2.0, especially extended 16-bit and 32-bit resolution and MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) \"Universal System Exclusive\" messages. The architecture intuitively models real-world (hardware) effect processors (and synthesizers) with a) zero or more input channels and one or more output channels, and b) a means for communication and control via MIDI. Such design simplicity is fundamental. There is very clear separation of concerns. There are no graphical user interfaces. There are no direct hardware or software controls. User interface is outside the scope of the library. You deal with that elsewhere, or perhaps not at all. Such design simplicity makes it easy for applications to be incorporated in any hardware or software host. MIDI is a very simple protocol with a well defined and evolving standard. The ability to use any MIDI controller (again both hardware or software) to control an application is a very powerful and intuitive concept. It is the very concept that gave MIDI widespread appeal and ubiquity to begin with. This simplified control scheme using MIDI also allows applications to be easily testable in isolation —a very desirable capability not typically found in more complex and monolithic systems.

Everywhere in this documentation, we will be using a namespace alias to make the code less verbose: namespace q = cycfi::q; In the realm of electronic music, there are processors and synthesizers, whose definitions overlap somewhat and differ primarily in how they handle input and output. The processor receives one or more input samples and generates one or more output samples according to a specific processing algorithm. A synthesizer, on the other hand, generates sound from scratch without using any samples. In the Q world, both processors and synthesizers are just function objects — C++ function objects, which are basic building blocks that can be composed to form more complex functions. A function object can accept zero or more input values and generate zero or more output values. Syntactically, you can use these functions just like any other function. For a single input function object, for example: float r = f(s); where s is the input value, and f(s) returns a result and stores it in the variable r. Typical audio processors in the Q DSP library work on floating point input samples with the normal -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, values are not limited to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels that are processed in the logarithmic domain, so dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output. For example: decibel gain = comp(env); comp is a compressor. The compressor above, however, processes signal envelopes rather than raw samples, in contrast to the typical implementation of DSP compressors. The compressor above accepts an envelope represented by decibel, performs computation in the logarithmic domain, and returns a compressed envelope also represented by decibel. Oscillators, as another example, operate on phase-angle inputs and return output samples: float out = sin(phase++); The Q DSP library has a rich set of such types: float and double Typical sample data type -1.0 to 1.0 (or beyond for some computational headroom). frequency Cycles per second (Hz). duration A time span (seconds, milliseconds, etc.) period The inverse of frequency. phase Fixed point 1.31 format where 31 bits are fractional. phase. represents 0 to 2π phase values suitable for oscillators. decibel Ratio of one value to another on a logarithmic scale (dB). See Units for further detail. The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe. You can not mismatch values of different types such as frequency and decibel, for example. Such potentially disastrous mistakes can happen if all values are just raw floating point types. There are conversions to and from these data types where it is reasonable to do so. decibel can, for example, be converted to 'float' or 'double' using the as_float or as_double conversion functions. Example: float gain = as_float(12_dB); Relational operations are allowed. For example: if (gain > 3_dB) // 3_dB is a decibel literal (see below) s = lp(s); Arithmetic operations are allowed. For example: auto total_duration = 3_ms + 5_ms; // 3_ms and 5_ms are duration literals Where appropriate, arithmetic with raw types are allowed. For example: auto harmonic = 440_Hz * 4; // 440_Hz is a frequency literal To augment the wealth of value types, the Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals. We take advantage of C++ type safe user-defined literals, instead of the usual float or double which can be unsafe when values of different units (e.g. frequency vs. duration) are mismatched. The Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as time, frequency and volume. For example, we use 24_dB, instead of a unit-less 24 or worse, a non-intuitive, unit-less 15.8 —the gain equivalent of 24_dB. Such constants also make the code very readable, another objective of this library. Q Literals are placed in the namespace q::literals.

The Q library does not have a GUI, for good reason! We want to keep it as simple as possible. The GUI is taken cared of by other libraries (e.g. Elements). After choosing the MIDI and Audio driver, the synth is playable. The synth is monophonic and responds to velocity only, for simplicity. There are more demo applications in the example directory. After this quick tutorial, free to explore. Here’s the actual synthesizer with the processing loop: struct my_square_synth : q::port_audio_stream { my_square_synth(q::envelope::config env_cfg, int device_id) : port_audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) , env(env_cfg, this->sampling_rate()) , filter(0.5, 0.8) {} void process(out_channels const& out) { auto left = out[0]; auto right = out[1]; for (auto frame : out.frames()) { // Generate the ADSR envelope auto env_ = env(); // Set the filter frequency filter.cutoff(env_); // Synthesize the square wave auto val = q::square(phase++); // Apply the envelope (amplifier and filter) with soft clip val = clip(filter(val) * env_); // Output right[frame] = left[frame] = val; } } q::phase_iterator phase; // The phase iterator q::envelope env; // The envelope q::reso_filter filter; // The resonant filter q::soft_clip clip; // Soft clip }; Our synth, a subclass of q::port_audio_stream, sets up buffers for the input and output audio streams and presents those to our processing loop (the process function above). In this example, we setup an audio stream with the selected device, no inputs and two (stereo) outputs: port_audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) Behind the scenes, there’s a lot going on here, actually. But you will notice that emphasis is given to making the library very readable, easy to understand and follow by breaking down complex tasks into smaller manageable tasks and using function composition at progressively higher levels, while maintaining simplicity and clarity of intent. The synthesizer above is composed of smaller building blocks: fine grained C++ function objects. For example, here’s the square wave oscillator (bandwidth limited using poly_blep). For now, we will skim over details such as the envelope, phase, and phase_iterator, and and this thing called poly blep. The important point, exemplified here, is that we want to keep our building blocks as simple and minimal as possible. We will cover that in greater detail later. The astute reader may notice that our square_synth class does not even have state! struct square_synth { constexpr float operator()(phase p, phase dt) const { constexpr auto middle = phase::middle(); auto r = p < middle ? 1.0f : -1.0f; // Correct rising discontinuity r += poly_blep(p, dt); // Correct falling discontinuity r -= poly_blep(p + middle, dt); return r; } constexpr float operator()(phase_iterator i) const { return (*this)(i._phase, i._incr); } }; constexpr auto square = square_synth{}; Yeah, that’s the complete oscillator. That’s all there is to it! :wink: The modern C savvy programmer will immediately notice the use of `constexpr`, applied judiciously all throughout the library. Such modern c facilities allow the compiler to generate extremely efficient code, even those that are generated at compile time. That means, for this example, that one can build an oscillator at compile time if needed, perhaps with constant wavetable results stored in read-only memory. The midi_processor takes care of MIDI events. Your application will have its own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI events that you are interested in. For this simple example, we simply want to process note-on and note-off events. On note-on events, our MIDI processor sets `my_square_synth’s note frequency and triggers its envelope for attack. On note-off events, our MIDI processor initiates the envelope’s release. struct my_midi_processor : midi::processor { using midi::processor::operator(); my_midi_processor(my_square_synth& synth) : _synth(synth) {} void operator()(midi::note_on msg, std::size_t time) { _key = msg.key(); auto freq = midi::note_frequency(_key); _synth.phase.set(freq, _synth.sampling_rate()); _synth.env.trigger(float(msg.velocity()) / 128); } void operator()(midi::note_off msg, std::size_t time) { if (msg.key() == _key) _synth.env.release(); } std::uint8_t _key; my_square_synth& _synth; }; In the main function, we instantiate my_square_synth and my_midi_processor. The synth constructor, in case you haven’t noticed yet, requires an envelope configuration (envelope::config). Here, we provide our configuration. Take note that in this example, the envelope parameters are constant, for the sake of simplicity, but you can definitely have these controllable by the user by writing your own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI control change messages. Again, take note of the abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as duration (e.g. 100_ms) and level (e.g. -12_dB). auto env_cfg = q::envelope::config { 100_ms // attack rate , 1_s // decay rate , -12_dB // sustain level , 5_s // sustain rate , 1_s // release rate }; my_square_synth synth{ env_cfg }; Then, we create my_midi_processor, giving it a reference to my_square_synth. We’ll also need a midi_input_stream that receives the actual incoming MIDI messages from the chosen hardware. q::midi_input_stream stream; my_midi_processor proc{ synth }; Now we’re all set. We start the synth and enter a loop that exits when the user presses ctrl-c (in which case the running flag becomes false). In the loop, we give our MIDI processor a chance to process incoming MIDI events as they arrive from the MIDI stream: synth.start(); while (running) stream.process(proc); synth.stop(); Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.

Q currently supports the MacOS, Windows and Linux. In the Mac, we support both XCode. Q is tested with XCode 10 and XCode 11. In Windows, we support Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2019, although it will probably also work with older versions of the Visual Studio IDE. In Linux, we support both Clang and gcc. Get the latest version with a C++17 compiler. The CLion IDE is supported on all platforms. Clone the Q DSP library and its submodules: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cycfi/Q.git Make sure you have CMake 3.5.1 or higher. Follow the installation procedure for your platform. There are multiple ways to generate a project file using CMake depending on your platform and desired IDE, but here are some examples for MacOS 10.14, Windows 10 and, and Ubuntu 16.04: Using XCode: CD to the Q library: cd Q Make a build directory: 'mkdir build' CD to the the Q/build directory: cd build Invoke cmake: cmake -G\"Xcode\" ../ If successful, cmake will generate an XCode project in the build directory. Using Visual Studio 2019 CD to the Q library: cd Q Make a build directory: 'mkdir build' CD to the the Q/build directory: cd build Invoke cmake: cmake -G\"Visual Studio 16 2019\" ../ If successful, cmake will generate an Visual Studio solution project in the build directory. Using dpkg packaging system, stock g++ compiler and CodeBlocks. Install portaudio dependencies: sudo apt-get install libasound-dev CD to the Q library: cd Q Make a build directory: 'mkdir build' CD to the the Q/build directory: cd build Invoke cmake: cmake -G\"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles\" ../ If successful, cmake will generate a CodeBlocks project in the build directory. Build the project generated by cmake. Try running the tests and examples. If you intend to run the executables directly from the command line, make sure to change the directory to the same level where the audio_files is (e.g. 1 folder up on XCode builds). Some tests and examples may require audio clips that are found in this folder. To make sure everything is OK, try running the sin_synth.cpp example. Make sure your system’s default audio device is set up and ready to play audio. The sin_synth.cpp program should play a 5 second 440 Hz sine wave. You might also want to try running the list_devices.cpp example that prints out all detected audio and MIDI devices. Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman. All rights reserved.

The symbol τ can also be used as a mathematical constant to represent 2π radians. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_unit struct phase : _unspecified_base_type_ { using base_type = _unspecified_base_type_; using base_type::base_type; constexpr static auto one_cyc = int_max(); constexpr static auto bits = sizeof(std::uint32_t) * 8; constexpr explicit phase(value_type val = 0); constexpr explicit phase(float frac); constexpr explicit phase(double frac); constexpr explicit phase(long double frac); constexpr phase(frequency freq, float sps); constexpr static phase begin(); constexpr static phase end(); constexpr static phase middle(); }; // Free functions constexpr double as_double(phase d); constexpr float as_float(phase d); In addition to valid expressions for Value, phase allows these expressions.

These values, unlike linear values, have restricted operations. Non-linear scalar values do not permit comparison with bare scalars (such as float), nor do they permit addition and subtraction with bare scalars.

In particular we’re going to look into some biquad highpass and lowpass filters as well as a delay effect. This examples are complete and self-contained in one .cpp file, kept as simple as possible to highlight the ease-of-use. Make sure you have a working sound system and the volume is up :) Take note that the demo is a console application. The Q library does not have a GUI, for good reason! We want to keep it as simple as possible. The GUI is taken cared of by other libraries (e.g. Elements). There are more demo applications in the example directory. After this quick tutorial, free to explore. Here’s the filter processor: struct filter_processor : q::port_audio_stream { filter_processor( q::wav_memory& wav , q::frequency hpfFreq , q::frequency lpfFreq ) : port_audio_stream(0, 2, wav.sps()) , _wav(wav) , _hpf(hpfFreq, wav.sps()) , _lpf(lpfFreq, wav.sps()) {} void process(out_channels const& out) { auto left = out[0]; auto right = out[1]; for (auto frame : out.frames()) { // Get the next input sample auto s = _wav()[0]; // Cascaded highpass and lowpass processing _y = _hpf(s), _y = _lpf(_y); // Output left[frame] = _y; right[frame] = _y; } } q::wav_memory& _wav; q::highpass _hpf; q::lowpass _lpf; float _y = 0.0f; }; As seen in other examples too, this is a subclass of q::port_audio_stream. We setup an audio stream with the default settings and provide the output audio stream to our processing loop (the process function seen above). filter_processor( q::wav_memory& wav , q::frequency hpfFreq , q::frequency lpfFreq ) : port_audio_stream(0, 2, wav.sps()) , _wav(wav) , _hpf(hpfFreq, wav.sps()) , _lpf(lpfFreq, wav.sps()) {} Moreover, we provide the class with the data of a wave file loaded from the hard disk as well as settings for the filters, namely cutoff frequencies. The sampling frequency is of course defined by the wave file. The filters are initialized: _hpf(hpfFreq, wav.sps()) _lpf(lpfFreq, wav.sps()) Now let’s take a closer look at the very \"flesh\" of our example, our process function: void process(out_channels const& out) { auto left = out[0]; auto right = out[1]; for (auto frame : out.frames()) { // Get the next input sample auto s = _wav()[0]; // Cascaded highpass and lowpass processing _y = _hpf(s), _y = _lpf(_y); // Output left[frame] = _y; right[frame] = _y; } } The first two lines give us access to the audio output stream: auto left = out[0]; auto right = out[1]; Then we loop through all the samples in the wave file, fetching one-by-one: auto s = _wav()[0]; And apply our filters in cascade to the every sample: _y = _hpf(s), _y = _lpf(_y); And finally send the processed sample off to the output stream: left[frame] = _y; right[frame] = _y; In the main function, we make sure to load our test audio file. q::wav_memory wav{ \"audio_files/Low E.wav\" }; The we initialize our audio stream by providing with the wave file and some drastic cutoff frequencies to make the result of the processing very apparent. filter_processor proc{ wav, 1_kHz, 2_kHz }; Now we’re ready to start the audio stream and wait for the audio file to be played to the end. if (proc.is_valid()) { proc.start(); q::sleep(q::duration(wav.length()) / wav.sps()); proc.stop(); } Similarly, in the delay.cpp example also found in the example folder, we have our delay processor: struct delay_processor : q::port_audio_stream { delay_processor( q::wav_memory& wav , q::duration delay , float feedback ) : port_audio_stream(0, 2, wav.sps()) , _wav(wav) , _delay(delay, wav.sps()) , _feedback(feedback) {} void process(out_channels const& out) { auto left = out[0]; auto right = out[1]; for (auto frame : out.frames()) { // Get the next input sample auto s = _wav()[0]; // Mix the signal and the delayed signal _y = s + _delay(); // Feed back the result to the delay _delay.push(_y * _feedback); // Output left[frame] = s; right[frame] = _y; } } q::wav_memory& _wav; q::delay _delay; float _feedback; float _y = 0.0f; }; The only difference here is that we initialize a delay effect and provide a value (between 0 to 1) to define how much feedback the delay will have: _delay(delay, wav.sps()) _feedback(feedback) In our process loop we mix the current sample with the sum of delayed samples and make sure to push the new sample to the delay stack with the defined feedback gain. _y = s + _delay(); _delay.push(_y * _feedback); In the main function we make sure to initiliaze our delay processor with the test audio file and delay and feedback parameters. delay_processor proc{ wav, 350_ms, 0.85f }; Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.
