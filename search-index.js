Fundamentals section of the Q DSP library provides a brief overview of the basic features of the library, including layering and dependencies, file structure, namespace, function objects as fundamental building blocks, rich data types, and user-defined literals. The Q library comprises of two layers: q_io: Audio and MIDI I/O layer. The q_io layer provides cross-platform audio and MIDI host connectivity straight out of the box. The q_io layer is optional. The q_lib layer is usable without it. q_lib: The core DSP library, q_lib is a no-frills, lightweight, header-only library. The dependencies are determined by the arrows. q_io has very minimal dependencies (portaudio and portmidi) with very loose coupling via thin wrappers that are easy to transplant and port to a host, with or without an operating system, such as an audio plugin or direct to hardware ADC and DAC. q_io is used in the tests and examples, but can be easily replaced by other mechanisms in an application. DAW (digital audio workstations), for example, have their own audio and MIDI I/O mechanisms. q_lib has no dependencies except the standard c++ library. The library is organized with this simplified directory structure: docs (1) example (2) q_io ├─ external (3) ├─ include (4) └─ src (5) q_lib └─ include (6) test (7) 1 Where this documentation resides. 2 Self-contained and easy to understand c++ programs that demonstrate various features of the library. 3 3rd party libraries used by the q_io module. 4 q_io header files. 5 q_io source files. 6 Header-only core q_lib DSP library. 7 A comprehensive set of c++ files for testing the library. Other sub-directories not listed here can be ignored. The q_lib module, header-only core, has this simplified directory structure: q_lib └─ include └─ q ├─ fft (1) ├─ fx (2) ├─ pitch (3) ├─ support (4) ├─ synth (5) └─ utility (6) 1 Fast fourier transform. 2 Various \"effects\" processor building blocks. 3 Pitch detection related facilities. 4 Fundamental support facilities. 5 Various synthesisers. 6 Auxiliary utility functions and classes. Other sub-directories not listed here can be ignored. All entities in the Q library are placed in namespace cycfi::q. Everywhere in this documentation, we will be using a namespace alias to make the code less verbose: namespace q = cycfi::q; Typical audio processors in the Q DSP library work on floating point input samples with the normal -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, values are not limited to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels that are processed in the logarithmic domain, so dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output. For example: decibel gain = comp(env); comp is a compressor. The compressor above, however, processes signal envelopes rather than raw samples, in contrast to the typical implementation of DSP compressors. The compressor above accepts an envelope represented by decibel, performs computation in the logarithmic domain, and returns a compressed envelope also represented by decibel. Oscillators, as another example, operate on phase-angle inputs and return output samples: float out = sin(phase++); The Q DSP library has a rich set of such types: float and double Typical sample data type -1.0 to 1.0 (or beyond for some computational headroom). frequency Cycles per second (Hz). duration A time span (seconds, milliseconds, etc.) period The inverse of frequency. phase Fixed point 1.31 format where 31 bits are fractional. phase. represents 0 to 2π phase values suitable for oscillators. decibel Ratio of one value to another on a logarithmic scale (dB). For more information, see Units. The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe. You can not mismatch values of different types such as frequency and decibel, for example. Such potentially disastrous mistakes can happen if all values are just raw floating point types. There are conversions to and from these data types where it is reasonable to do so. decibel can, for example, be converted to 'float' or 'double' using the as_float or as_double conversion functions. Example: float gain = as_float(12_dB); Relational operations are allowed. For example: if (gain > 3_dB) // 3_dB is a decibel literal (see below) s = lp(s); Arithmetic operations are allowed. For example: auto total_duration = 3_ms + 5_ms; // 3_ms and 5_ms are duration literals Where appropriate, arithmetic with raw types are allowed. For example: auto harmonic = 440_Hz * 4; // 440_Hz is a frequency literal To augment the wealth of value types, the Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals. We take advantage of C++ type safe user-defined literals, instead of the usual float or double which can be unsafe when values of different units (e.g. frequency vs. duration) are mismatched. The Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as time, frequency and volume. For example, we use 24_dB, instead of a unit-less 24 or worse, a non-intuitive, unit-less 15.8 —the gain equivalent of 24_dB. Such constants also make the code very readable, another objective of this library. Q Literals are placed in the namespace q::literals. The namespace is sparse enough to be hoisted into your namespace using using namespace: To use these literals, include the literals.hpp header: #include then use the literals namespace somewhere in a scope where you need it: using namespace q::literals; Here are some example expressions: 82.4069_Hz 440_Hz 1.5_KHz 1.5_kHz 1_kHz 0.5_MHz 3_MHz 10.3_s 1_s 20.5_ms 1_ms 10.5_us 500_us -3.5_dB 10_dB 2_pi 0.5_pi Here’s the list of available literals: // frequency constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(unsigned long long int val); // duration constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(unsigned long long int val); // decibel constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(unsigned long long int val); constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(long double val); // pi constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(long double val); constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(unsigned long long int val) In the realm of electronic music, there are processors and synthesizers, whose definitions overlap somewhat and differ primarily in how they handle input and output. The processor receives one or more input samples and generates one or more output samples according to a specific processing algorithm. A synthesizer, on the other hand, generates sound from scratch without using any samples. The C++ function object is the most basic building block. In the Q world, both processors and synthesizers are simply function objects, which can be composed to form more complex functions. A function object can accept zero or more input values and generate zero or more output values. Function objects are instantiated from struct or class declarations in the header files. In this example, we instantiate hypothetical f_x and g_x structs: auto f = f_x{}; auto g = g_x{}; Syntactically, you can use these function objects just like any other function. Here’s an example function call invocation for the single input function object, f instantiated above: float r = f(s); where s is the input value, and f(s) returns a result and stores it in the variable r. Composition by passing the result of f to g, like this: float r = g(f(s)); can be encapsulated using function composition in a class or struct: struct fg_x { float operator()(float s) const { return g(f(s)); } f_x f; g_x g; }; Here, we encapsulate f_x and g_x inside the composed function object struct fg_x. We can then instantiate a function object for fg_x just like we would above. The Q DSP library uses fine-grained and reusable function object structs or classes like this. Such reusable components are composed to form more powerful higher level composites. Here’s the code example in the library for signal conditioning: inline float signal_conditioner::operator()(float s) { // High pass s = _hp(s); (1) // Pre clip s = _clip(s); (2) // Dynamic Smoother s = _sm(s); (3) // Signal envelope auto env = _env(std::abs(s)); (4) // Noise gate auto gate = _gate(env); (5) s *= _gate_env(gate); (6) // Compressor + makeup-gain auto env_db = decibel(env); auto gain = as_float(_comp(env_db)) * _makeup_gain; (7) s = s * gain; _post_env = env * gain; return s; } We’re showing only the operator() for brevity. But take note that the code uses multiple function objects for various processing functions that correspond to these class member variables: private: using noise_gate = basic_noise_gate; clip _clip; (2) highpass _hp; (1) dynamic_smoother _sm; (3) fast_envelope_follower _env; (4) float _post_env; compressor _comp; (7) float _makeup_gain; noise_gate _gate; (5) envelope_follower _gate_env; (6) }; The complete code can be found here: signal_conditioner.hpp Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.

The full example can be found here: example/delay.cpp. The example loads a pre-recorded wav file and plays it back with processing. The raw audio source will be played in the left channel while the delayed signal will be played in the right channel. Pretty much as straightforward as possible. The audio will be played using the currently selected audio device. The final audio output can be heard below: Your browser does not support the audio tag. // fractional delay (1) q::delay _delay{350_ms, 44100}; // Mix the signal s, and the delayed signal (where s is the incoming sample) (2) auto _y = s + _delay(); // Feed back the result to the delay (2) _delay.push(_y * _feedback); Normally, there will be a processing loop that receives the incoming samples, s. The code above are placed: 1 Before the processing loop. 2 Inside inside the processing loop. Typically, you encapsulate the code inside a class where _delay, _y and _feedback are member variables. 44100 is the desired sampling rate. _feedback is the amount of feedback desired (anything from 0.0 to less than 1.0, e.g. 0.85). 350_ms is the delay duration. Take note of 350_ms. Here, we take advantage of C++ type safe user-defined literals, instead of the usual float or double which can be unsafe when values of different units (e.g. frequency vs. duration) are mismatched. The Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as time, frequency and volume. For example, we use 24_dB, instead of a unit-less 24 or worse, a non-intuitive, unit-less 15.8 —the gain equivalent of 24_dB. Such constants also make the code very readable, another objective of this library. Processors such as q::delay are C++ function objects that can be composed to form more complex processors. For example if you want to filter the delayed signal with a low-pass filter with a 1 kHz cutoff frequency, you apply the q::lowpass filter over the result of the delay: q::lowpass _lp{1_kHz, 44100}; then insert the filter where it is needed in the processing loop: // Add the signal s, and the delayed, low-pass filtered signal auto _y = s + _lp(_delay()); Let us move on to a more elaborate example. How about a fully functional, bandwidth limited square wave synthesizer with ADSR envelope that controls an amplifier and a resonant filter and control the note-on and note-off using MIDI? Sounds good? This example is complete and self-contained in one .cpp file, kept as simple as possible to highlight the ease-of-use. The full example can be found here: example/square_synth.cpp. Here’s a short video clip: After building the program, make sure you have a MIDI keyboard connected before starting the application. At startup, the app will present you with a list of available MIDI hardware and will ask you what you want to use: ================================================================================ Available MIDI Devices (ID : \"Name\" inputs/outputs): 0 : \"Code 61 USB MIDI\" 1/0 1 : \"Code 61 MIDI DIN\" 1/0 2 : \"Code 61 Mackie/HUI\" 1/0 3 : \"Code 61 Editor\" 1/0 4 : \"ZOOM R16_R24\" 1/0 5 : \"Code 61 USB MIDI\" 0/1 6 : \"Code 61 MIDI DIN\" 0/1 7 : \"Code 61 Mackie/HUI\" 0/1 8 : \"Code 61 Editor\" 0/1 9 : \"ZOOM R16_R24\" 0/1 ================================================================================ Choose MIDI Device ID: 0 And then a list of audio devices to choose from: ================================================================================ Available Audio Devices (ID : \"Name\" inputs/outputs): 0 : \"Built-in Microphone\" 2/0 1 : \"Built-in Output\" 0/2 2 : \"HDMI\" 0/2 3 : \"ZOOM R16_R24 Driver\" 8/2 ================================================================================ Choose Audio Device ID: 3 Take note that the demo is a console application. The Q library does not have a GUI, for good reason! We want to keep it as simple as possible. The GUI is taken cared of by other libraries (e.g. Elements). After choosing the MIDI and Audio driver, the synth is playable. The synth is monophonic and responds to velocity only, for simplicity. There are more demo applications in the example directory. After this quick tutorial, feel free to explore. Here’s the actual synthesizer with the processing loop: struct my_square_synth : q::port_audio_stream { my_square_synth(q::envelope::config env_cfg, int device_id) : port_audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) , env(env_cfg, this->sampling_rate()) , filter(0.5, 0.8) {} void process(out_channels const& out) { auto left = out[0]; auto right = out[1]; for (auto frame : out.frames()) { // Generate the ADSR envelope auto env_ = env(); // Set the filter frequency filter.cutoff(env_); // Synthesize the square wave auto val = q::square(phase++); // Apply the envelope (amplifier and filter) with soft clip val = clip(filter(val) * env_); // Output right[frame] = left[frame] = val; } } q::phase_iterator phase; // The phase iterator q::envelope env; // The envelope q::reso_filter filter; // The resonant filter q::soft_clip clip; // Soft clip }; Our synth, a subclass of q::port_audio_stream, sets up buffers for the input and output audio streams and presents those to our processing loop (the process function above). In this example, we setup an audio stream with the selected device, no inputs and two (stereo) outputs: port_audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) Behind the scenes, there’s a lot going on here, actually. But you will notice that emphasis is given to making the library very readable, easy to understand and follow by breaking down complex tasks into smaller manageable tasks and using function composition at progressively higher levels, while maintaining simplicity and clarity of intent. The synthesizer above is composed of smaller building blocks: fine grained C++ function objects. For example, here’s the square wave oscillator (bandwidth limited using poly_blep). For now, we will skim over details such as the envelope, phase, and phase_iterator, and and this thing called poly blep. The important point, exemplified here, is that we want to keep our building blocks as simple and minimal as possible. We will cover that in greater detail later. The astute reader may notice that our square_synth class does not even have state! struct square_synth { constexpr float operator()(phase p, phase dt) const { constexpr auto middle = phase::middle(); auto r = p < middle ? 1.0f : -1.0f; // Correct rising discontinuity r += poly_blep(p, dt); // Correct falling discontinuity r -= poly_blep(p + middle, dt); return r; } constexpr float operator()(phase_iterator i) const { return (*this)(i._phase, i._incr); } }; constexpr auto square = square_synth{}; Yeah, that’s the complete oscillator. That’s all there is to it! :wink: The modern C savvy programmer will immediately notice the use of `constexpr`, applied judiciously all throughout the library. Such modern c facilities allow the compiler to generate extremely efficient code, even those that are generated at compile time. That means, for this example, that one can build an oscillator at compile time if needed, perhaps with constant wavetable results stored in read-only memory. The midi_processor takes care of MIDI events. Your application will have its own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI events that you are interested in. For this simple example, we simply want to process note-on and note-off events. On note-on events, our MIDI processor sets `my_square_synth’s note frequency and triggers its envelope for attack. On note-off events, our MIDI processor initiates the envelope’s release. struct my_midi_processor : midi::processor { using midi::processor::operator(); my_midi_processor(my_square_synth& synth) : _synth(synth) {} void operator()(midi::note_on msg, std::size_t time) { _key = msg.key(); auto freq = midi::note_frequency(_key); _synth.phase.set(freq, _synth.sampling_rate()); _synth.env.trigger(float(msg.velocity()) / 128); } void operator()(midi::note_off msg, std::size_t time) { if (msg.key() == _key) _synth.env.release(); } std::uint8_t _key; my_square_synth& _synth; }; In the main function, we instantiate my_square_synth and my_midi_processor. The synth constructor, in case you haven’t noticed yet, requires an envelope configuration (envelope::config). Here, we provide our configuration. Take note that in this example, the envelope parameters are constant, for the sake of simplicity, but you can definitely have these controllable by the user by writing your own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI control change messages. Again, take note of the abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as duration (e.g. 100_ms) and level (e.g. -12_dB). auto env_cfg = q::envelope::config { 100_ms // attack rate , 1_s // decay rate , -12_dB // sustain level , 5_s // sustain rate , 1_s // release rate }; my_square_synth synth{ env_cfg }; Then, we create my_midi_processor, giving it a reference to my_square_synth. We’ll also need a midi_input_stream that receives the actual incoming MIDI messages from the chosen hardware. q::midi_input_stream stream; my_midi_processor proc{ synth }; Now we’re all set. We start the synth and enter a loop that exits when the user presses ctrl-c (in which case the running flag becomes false). In the loop, we give our MIDI processor a chance to process incoming MIDI events as they arrive from the MIDI stream: synth.start(); while (running) stream.process(proc); synth.stop(); Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.

The dynamic range of an audio signal is the difference between its loudest and quietest components. Compression, Expansion, Limiting, and Gating are a few common types of dynamic range processing used in audio DSP. Such processing can enhance sound quality, minimize or eliminate noise, and create creative effects. The dynamic range processors in the Q DSP library are unique in that they do not process audio waveform samples directly. Instead, they operate on the envelope of the audio signal, represented as decibel, perform computations in the logarithmic domain, and returns a processed envelope, also represented as decibel. As an example, here’s the processing code for the compressor: decibel compressor::operator()(decibel env) const { if (env <= _threshold) return 0_dB; return _slope * (_threshold - env); } This is a hard knee compressor: a type of compressor in which the compression ratio changes abruptly when the input signal exceeds the threshold level, known as the knee point. Both hard knee and soft knee compressors are supported by the Q DSP library. The code accepts an envelope input, env, in decibels and outputs a compressed envelope also in decibels. Processing is done in the logarithmic domain, where addition of two values is equivalent to multiplying their corresponding linear values, and multiplication of two values is equivalent to raising their corresponding linear values to a power. The envelope follower, which is responsible for generating the input envelope for the compressor, is implemented outside of the compressor class. The objective is separation of concerns and the flexibility to use various envelope followers. Compared to their linear counterparts, performing computations in the logarithmic domain is simpler, more intuitive, and makes the code easier to understand while maintaining the same level of efficiency. The compressor example above and all dynamic range processors in the Q DSP library are essentially envelope processors. They receive envelopes, process envelopes, and return envelopes. Since envelope processors operate on the envelope, perform computations in the logarithmic domain, and return a processed envelope, multiple envelope processors can be cascaded. For instance, you can use a single envelope follower and apply the derived envelope to an expander and then pass the result to a compressor, like in the diagram below: A specific use-case for cascading an expander and a compressor, like in the example above, is when you want to use the expander as a noise gate, with soft, non-abrupt gating, set at a threshold just above the noise floor. Then, setting the threshold of the compressor to a high value to even out the dynamic range. The compressor and expander in this case work on different regions of the full dynamic range. But there are also useful cases where the overlap of dynamic ranges the processors are working on is advantageous. The compressor-limiter is a good example. Likewise, multiple compressors with variable thresholds and ratios are another example. By cascading multiple dynamic range processors, we can design efficient multi-function processors like the compressor-limiter with gate (transfer response graph at the right).","title":"Dynamic","component":"q","version":"1","name":"dynamic","url":"/q/1/reference/dynamic.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":2},{"text":"Key Points","hash":"_key_points","id":3},{"text":"Cascading","hash":"_cascading","id":4}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"This section deals with envelope extraction from signals. In audio DSP, an envelope efers to the time-varying changes of a signal. It essentially represents the \"shape\" of the signal in terms of its moment-to-moment changes. Extracting an envelope from a signal is particularly important because they can be used for a variety of processing tasks, including controlling the perceived loudness of a signal, reducing noise, emphasizing particular elements of the signal, modulating amplitude, frequency, and other sound properties, to name a few. Envelopes are typically, but not always, related to amplitude changes, although it can sometimes be related to other parameters like pitch or frequency, phase, and filter cutoff, to name a few. This section will only cover amplitude envelope extraction. Figure 1. Output behavior of different types of envelope followers. The amplitude envelope can also be used to extract dynamic features from a sound. As an example, onset detection is a method for determining the beginning of each musical note. The most basic onset detection scheme involves analyzing the amplitude envelope and detecting sudden changes in amplitude that coincide with the start of each note. [1] The Q DSP library includes a variety of envelope extractors, ranging from the most basic peak envelope follower to the more precise, but computationally demanding, fast RMS envelope follower. Each has distinct strengths, characteristics, and tradeoffs that can be evaluated based on the application’s specific requirements. Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman. All rights reserved.

On the other hand, it performs admirably in the time domain. The moving average filter is optimal in reducing random noise while retaining a sharp step response. Averaging N samples (the moving average window size) increases the SNR by the square root of N. For example, N=16 improves SNR by 4 (12dB). The filter delay is exactly (N−1)/2. Figure 1.

These processors typically operate with floating-point input samples in the typical -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, the values are not restricted to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels processed in the logarithmic domain. Consequently, dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output. The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe, which means that each data type is explicitly defined and enforced. This is crucial because it avoids the potentially catastrophic errors that could result from mismatching values of different types. For example, if all values were just raw floating point types, it would be possible to accidentally mix up the frequency and decibel values. Mistakenly interchanging frequency and decibel values could result in erroneous processing of the audio signal and will lead to undefined results. This document aims to provide comprehensive documentation of the fundamental data types used by the Q DSP library. These basic units are utilized consistently throughout the library and serve as the basis for quantifying specific parameters, such as decibels (dB) for signal level and hertz (Hz) for frequency. \"Value\" is a conceptual representation of a linear numerical quantity.

In a soft knee compressor, the compression ratio gradually increases as the input signal level approaches the threshold level, rather than immediately switching to the ratio at the threshold. This produces a smoother and more natural-sounding compression effect. Soft knee compressors are used when a transparent and subtle compression effect is desired. Both hard knee and soft knee compressors are supported by the Q DSP library. #include struct soft_knee_compressor { soft_knee_compressor(decibel threshold, decibel width, float ratio); decibel operator()(decibel env) const; void threshold(decibel val); void width(decibel val); void ratio(float ratio); decibel threshold() const; decibel width() const; float ratio() const; }; comp, a, b Objects of type soft_knee_compressor t, w, env Objects of type decibel r Scalar value for compression ratio. Expression Semantics soft_knee_compressor(t, w, r) Construct a soft_knee_compressor from t (threshold), w (width), and r (ratio). soft_knee_compressor(comp) Copy construct from soft_knee_compressor comp. a = b Assign b to a. C++ brace initialization may also be used. The ratio parameter, r, specifies the amount of gain applied. With the typical \"n:1\" notation for compressors, the ratio parameter is 1/n, thereby the ratio for compressors is normally from 0.0…​1.0. For example, a 4:1 compression is 1/4 or 0.25. Signal rising above the threshold is attenuated, compressing the signal. For every dB above the threshold, t, the signal is attenuated by n dB. For example, with a ratio of 4:1 (0.25), 1dB above the threshold is attenuated by 4dB. Expression Semantics Return Type comp(env) Process the input envelope env and return the compressed result. decibel The output is the compressed gain, also in decibels. Simply multiply the signal by the result converted to float using as_float (or double using as_double). For example: auto gain = as_float(comp(env)); (1) auto left_out = left_signal * gain; (2) auto right_out = right_signal * gain; (3) 1 env is the computed envelope (e.g.) using an envelope follower. gain is obtained from the env processed by comp and converted to float. 2 Stereo left_signal multiplied by gain. 3 Stereo right_signal multiplied by gain. Typically, you add some makeup gain after compression to compensate for the gain reduction.

During the attack phase of an audio signal, the AR envelope follower attempts to follow the signal but is constrained by the attack duration. A longer attack period gives a softer response, exponentially increasing. When the signal level drops below the peak, the follower gradually releases the peak level with an exponential decay. The AR envelope follower models the behavior of two resistors, one for attack, and one for release, each connected in series with an ideal diode —with no voltage drop—, tied together and connected to a capacitor. During attacks, the capacitor charges through the attack resistor, exponentially increasing. The capacitor discharges through the release resistor as the audio signal falls below the peak charge, causing the output voltage to progressively decay with an exponential curve. Figure 1. AR envelope follower response The plot in Figure 1 depicts the response of the AR envelope follower, which was obtained by picking the guitar’s low-E string and using a 2-milliseconds attack duration and 2-second release duration (envelope: magenta, signal: blue, absolute value of the signal: dark blue). It is worth noting that we use the absolute value of the signal to capture both the positive and negative sides of the waveform, as indicated by the dark blue plot. The AR envelope follower does not perform this operation automatically, allowing you to perform any necessary preprocessing before computing the envelope. This flexibility enables you, for example, to capture only the positive or negative peaks, or perhaps the square of the signal, depending on your application needs.

Basically, the result of the fast envelope follower is the maximum of N peak values taken simultaneously. Each value is the maximum of the current sample and the latest held peak value. Each of the peak values are reset to zero in a round-robin fashion. As a peak value is reset, the other peak values still hold the latest peak value. The highest peak among N peaks is then chosen as the current output. Figure 1. Fast Envelope Detector The plot in Figure 2 below shows the fast envelope follower’s response. As compared to the Peak Envelope Follower and AR Envelope Follower, the fast envelope follower’s superior performance is immediately apparent in the plot. Of course, this comes at the cost of additional computing complexity. Figure 2. Fast envelope follower response The reset cycle time is specified by the hold duration parameter. The number of peak values is specified by the div parameter. The plot was obtained by picking the guitar’s low-E string and using a hold duration of approximately 6 ms and with a div of 2 (envelope: red, signal: blue, absolute value of the signal: dark blue).

The peak envelope follower models the behavior of an ideal diode —with no voltage drop— connected in series with a resistor and a capacitor connected in parallel.

When the release duration is too fast, the peak envelope follower quickly releases the previous cycle’s peak and begins tracking the peak of the next cycle, causing ripples in the envelope follower’s output, as shown in the image on the right. Such ripples can cause unwanted modulation and can be heard as distortion or noise in the audio signal.

Such a format is perfectly suitable for oscillators. For that purpose, a phase accumulator can be used: essentially a counter that keeps track of the current phase value for the waveform. Initially, the accumulator is set to an arbitrary starting phase, usually 0. To generate the next sample of the waveform, we compute the phase value for the next sample based on the desired frequency and the sample rate. This value is then added to the current phase accumulator value. This process continues for each successive sample in the waveform. The advantage of using fixed point 1.31 to represent phase is that the phase accumulator inherently rewraps the value when the next phase exceeds 2π. This behavior is inherent to the fixed-point 1.31 format and eliminates the need for additional logic to handle the wraparound condition. Also, see phase_iterator for further additional relevant information. #include struct phase : _unspecified_base_type_ { constexpr explicit phase(value_type val = 0); constexpr explicit phase(float frac); constexpr explicit phase(double frac); constexpr explicit phase(long double frac); constexpr phase(frequency freq, float sps); constexpr static phase begin(); constexpr static phase end(); constexpr static phase middle(); }; // Free functions constexpr double as_double(phase d); constexpr float as_float(phase d); In addition to valid expressions for Value, phase allows these expressions. f A double or float, representing a fractional number from 0.0 to 1.0 (corresponding to 0 to 2π). freq Object of type frequency sps Scalar value representing samples per second p Object of type phase Expression Semantics phase(f) Construct a phase from f. phase(freq, sps) Construct a phase from the freq and sps C++ brace initialization may also be used.
