== Overview

`audio_file` is a set of small and lightweight classes for reading and writing WAV (Waveform Audio File Format) files. It offers a straightforward and intuitive interface for working with WAV audio data. This includes:

`wav_reader` :: For reading WAV files.
`wav_writer` :: For writing WAV files.
`wav_memory` :: For reading WAV files and storing into memory, thereby providing fast random access to all the samples.

== Include

```c++
#include <q_io/audio_file.hpp>
```

== wav_reader

`wav_reader` is a class for reading WAV files with the typical read-only input mechanisms, such as incrementally reading a chunk of audio data from a position starting at the beginning of the file, and being able to move a certain position in the file.

=== Declaration

```c++
class wav_reader : _unspecified_base_type_
{
public:

                  wav_reader(std::string filename);
                  wav_reader(char const* filename);

   std::size_t    length() const;
   std::size_t    position();
   bool           restart();
   bool           seek(std::uint64_t target);

   std::size_t    read(float* data, std::uint32_t len);
   std::size_t    read(std::ranges::range auto& buffer);
};
```
