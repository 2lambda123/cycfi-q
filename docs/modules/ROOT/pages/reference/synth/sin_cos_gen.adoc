= Sine Cosine Generator

include::../../common.adoc[]

== Overview

sin_cos_gen: Generates sine and cosine waves simultaneously. Generates
sine and cosine waves at the same time. The Chamberlin state variable
filter is optimized for infinite Q oscillation.

1. Suitable as a low frequency sine wave oscillator. The upper
   frequency limit for stability is roughly 1/6 sps.
2. At low frequencies, the waveform symmetry is very pure, but it
   becomes skewed as you approach the upper limit.
3. For low frequencies, we can reduce the calculation of the
   coefficient to 2*Pi*freq/sps.
4. When utilized with fixed point or IEEE floating point, the
   oscallator should run forever without instability.
