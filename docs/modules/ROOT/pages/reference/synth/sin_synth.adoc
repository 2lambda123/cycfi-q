= Sine Wave Synthesizer

include::../../common.adoc[]

== Overview

The sine wave synthesizer efficiently synthesizes sine waves from a lookup table to avoid performing complex calculations in real-time. The lookup table is optimized for use in small MCUs (microconrrollers), by having the data stored as c++ `constexpr` array, which is effectively placed in flash memory.

== Include

```c++
#include <q/synth/sin_synth.hpp>
```

== Declaration

```c++
struct sin_synth
{
   constexpr float operator()(phase p) const;
   constexpr float operator()(phase_iterator i) const;
};

constexpr auto sin = sin_synth{};
```

== Expressions

`sin_synth` is a model of `{basic_synth}` and implements all valid expressions of `{basic_synth}`. `sin_synth` is stateless. The global instance `sin` can be used anywhere without needing to be placed in a class or struct. It is semantically equivalent to a global function.
