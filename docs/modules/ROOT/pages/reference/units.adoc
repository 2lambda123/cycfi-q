== Overview

image:decibel.png[alt="dB Image courtesy of Wikipedia", float="right"] The Q DSP library processes audio signals by applying various audio processors to sample inputs. These processors typically operate with floating-point input samples in the typical -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, the values are not restricted to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels processed in the logarithmic domain. Consequently, dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output.

The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe, which means that each data type is explicitly defined and enforced. This is crucial because it avoids the potentially catastrophic errors that could result from mismatching values of different types. For example, if all values were just raw floating point types, it would be possible to accidentally mix up the frequency and decibel values. Mistakenly interchanging frequency and decibel values could result in erroneous processing of the audio signal and will lead to undefined results.

This document aims to provide comprehensive documentation of the fundamental data types used by the Q DSP library. These basic units are utilized consistently throughout the library and serve as the basis for quantifying specific parameters, such as decibels (dB) for signal level and hertz (Hz) for frequency.

== Value

"Value" is a conceptual representation of a linear numerical quantity.

A representation of a non-linear scalar value as a concept. Unlike linear values, `NonLinearValue`, by default, does not permit arithmetic operations, although certain models of `NonLinearValue` may permit restricted arithmetic operations as necessary. Comparison operators are allowed.

== NonLinearValue Models

=== decibel

Decibel is non-linear and operates on the logarithmic domain. The `decibel` class is perfectly suitable for dynamics processing (e.g. compressors and limiters and envelopes). Q provides fast `decibel` computations using fast math functions and lookup tables for converting to and from scalars.

   constexpr decibel    operator-() const;

   constexpr decibel&   operator+=(decibel b);

```

==== Expressions

In addition to valid expressions for `NonLinearValue`, `decibel` allows these expressions.

==== Notation

`a`, `b`, `d`  :: Instance of `decibel`
`v`            :: Scalar value.

==== Arithmetic

`decibel` extends `NonLinearValue` and has a complete set of arithmetic operations with `decibel` operands, and a restricted set of arithmetic operations with mixed `decibel` and bare scalars only for multiplication and division.

=== pitch

`pitch` is determined by its position on the chromatic scale, which is a system of 12 notes that repeat in octaves. The distance between each pitch on the chromatic scale is a semitone, and each pitch represents a specific frequency measured in hertz (Hz).

The `pitch` struct includes construction from `frequency` as well as scalars representing the absolute position in the chromatic scale from the base frequency of `8.1757989156437` Hz, which is an octave below F#0. The constructors support both fixed (integer) positions (e.g. 48 semitones) above the base frequency, and fractional positions (e.g. 120.6 semitones) above the base frequency.

The `pitch` struct also includes conversions to `frequency`. Q provides fast `pitch` computations using fast math functions.

#include <q/support/pitch.hpp>
