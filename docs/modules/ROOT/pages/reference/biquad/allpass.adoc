All pass second-order IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter. This filter is embodied by the `allpass` class.

== Include

```c++
#include <q/fx/biquad.hpp>
```

== Declaration

```c++
struct allpass : biquad
{
         allpass(frequency f, float sps, double q = 0.707);
   void  config(frequency f, float sps, double q = 0.707)
};
```

:biquad: xref:reference/biquad.adoc[biquad]

== Expressions

In addition to valid expressions for {biquad}, `allpass` allows these
expressions.

=== Notation

`ap`     :: Instance of `allpass`.
`f`      :: Instance of `frequency`.
`sps`    :: Samples per second.
`q`      :: Q or quality factor.
