```

== Declaration

```c++
struct highpass : biquad
{
         highpass(frequency f, float sps, double q = 0.707);
   void  config(frequency f, float sps, double q = 0.707)
};
```

== Expressions

In addition to valid expressions for {biquad}, `highpass` allows these
expressions.

=== Notation

`hp`     :: Instance of `highpass`.
`f`      :: Instance of `frequency`.
`sps`    :: Samples per second.
`q`      :: Q or quality factor.

=== Construction

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Expression            | Semantics

| `highpass(f, sps)`    |  Construct a `highpass` filter from `f`, `sps`. `q` defaults to `0.707`
| `highpass(f, sps, q)` |  Construct a `highpass` filter from `f`, `sps` and `q`.

NOTE: C++ brace initialization may also be used.
