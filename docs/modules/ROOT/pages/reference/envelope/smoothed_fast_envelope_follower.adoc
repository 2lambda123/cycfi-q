= Smoothed Fast Envelope Follower

include::../../common.adoc[]

== Synopsis

The Smoothed Fast Envelope Follower is a variation of the {fast_envelope_follower}. It is a simple composite class that contains a fast envelope follower member and a moving average filter member to smooth out the staircase ripples. One advantage of a moving average filter over a standard low-pass filter is that its output has less distortion of the envelope's shape due to its linear phase response. It does not introduce phase shifts, thus keeping the signal's time-domain shape mostly intact.

// $$$ TODO $$$ Link to moving average filter when we have it.

== Response

The plot in Figure 1 below shows the smoothed fast envelope followerâ€™s response (envelope: pink, signal: blue, absolute value of the signal: dark blue).

The plot in Figure 2 below shows the plain and smoothed fast envelope follower's response. The fast envelope follower's staircase-like envelope is effectively smoothed out using a moving average filter with the same duration as the `hold` parameter. The moving average filter transforms the hard staircase edges into soft ramps.

== Include

```c++
#include <q/fx/envelope.hpp>
```

== Declaration

```c++
template <std::size_t div>
struct basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower
{
            basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower(duration hold, float sps);

    float   operator()(float s);
    float   operator()() const;
};

using smoothed_fast_envelope_follower = basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower<2>;
```

`basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower` essentially follows the same API as {fast_envelope_follower}.

`basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower` is a template class parameterized by `div`, which must be >= 1. `div` specifies the minimum duration required for the `hold` parameter. The hold duration should be equal to or slightly longer than 1/`div` multiplied by the period of the lowest frequency of the signal we wish to track. For example, if the lowest frequency we wish to track is 440 Hz, and `div` = 2, then the `hold` parameter should be greater than 1.13 ms.

`smoothed_fast_envelope_follower` is an alias for `basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower<2>`. In general, this is all you need to use, unless you want finer granularity. The higher the `div` is, the finer the granularity possible. Again, all of these comes at the cost of additional computing complexity.

== Expressions

=== Notation

`env_t`             :: A `basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower<div>` type.
`env`, `a`, `b`     :: Instances of `basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower<div>`
`hold`              :: Instance of `duration`
`sps`               :: Scalar value for samples per second.
`s`                 :: Scalar value for the latest input sample.

=== Constructors and Assignment

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Expression            | Semantics

| `env_t(hold, sps)`    | Construct a `basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower<div>` given `hold` (hold duration) and `sps` (samples per second).
| `env_t(env)`          | Copy construct from `basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower<div> env`.
| `a = b`               | Assign `b` to `a`.
|===

NOTE: C++ brace initialization may also be used.

`env_t` is just a shortcut notation for any type or alias to a template instantiation of `basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower<div>`. Example:

```c++
using my_env_t = basic_smoothed_fast_envelope_follower<4>;
```

=== Function Call
