{db-amplitude}The decibel (dB) is a unit used to measure the relative signal level difference between two signals. It is a logarithmic scale that expresses the relationship between two signal root-power amplitudes or power levels. Here, we are concerned with amplitudes.

For amplitudes gain, the relationship is given by:

```
20 log10(out/in) = dB
```

where `out` represents the output amplitude, while in represents the `input` amplitude.

The decibel scale is expressed as the base 10 logarithm of the ratio between two amplitudes. For instance, a ratio of 2:1 (two times) corresponds to a 6 dB increase, while a ratio of 10:1 (ten times) corresponds to a 20 dB increase. In contrast, a ratio of 1:2 (one half) corresponds to a -6 dB decrease, whereas a ratio of 1:10 (one tenth) corresponds to a -20 dB decrease.

Decibel is non-linear and operates on the logarithmic domain. The `decibel` class is perfectly suitable for dynamics processing (e.g. compressors and limiters and envelopes). Q provides fast `decibel` computations using fast math functions and lookup tables for converting to and from scalars.

== Include

```c++
#include <q/support/decibel.hpp>
```

== Declaration

```c++
struct decibel : _unspecified_base_type_
{
   using base_type = _unspecified_base_type_;
   using base_type::base_type;

   constexpr            decibel();
   explicit             decibel(double val);
};

// Free functions
double               as_double(decibel db);
constexpr float      as_float(decibel db);
inline decibel       approx_db(float val);
```

Everywhere in this reference documentation, the term _scalar_ refers to unitless arithmetic scalar types. This concept is captured in this C++ concept declaration:

```c++
namespace cycfi::q::concepts
{
   template <typename T>
   concept ArithmeticScalar = std::integral<T> || std::floating_point<T>;
}
```

== Expressions

`decibel` is a model of `{Unit}`. In addition to valid expressions for `{Unit}`, `decibel` allows these expressions.

=== Notation

`d`   :: Object of type `decibel`.
`v`   :: Scalar value.

=== Constructor

The main decibel constructor from a scalar value (i.e. `decibel(v)`) performs linear to decibel conversion. If you do not wish to perform this conversion and store the decibel value directly in the underlying scalar representation, you can use the direct constructor (see `{Unit}`).

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Expression      |  Semantics

| `decibel(v)`    |  Construction from scaler `v` with conversion from linear to decibel.
|===

If you need to create `decibel` from numeric constants, it is preferrable to use `decibel` literals instead. Example:

```c++
auto db = -6_dB;
```

NOTE: C++ brace initialization may also be used.
