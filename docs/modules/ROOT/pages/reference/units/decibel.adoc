{db-amplitude}The decibel (dB) is a unit used to measure the relative signal level difference between two signals. It is a logarithmic scale that expresses the relationship between two signal root-power amplitudes or power levels. Here, we are concerned with amplitudes.

For amplitudes gain, the relationship is given by:

```
20 log10(out/in) = dB
```

where `out` represents the output amplitude, while in represents the `input` amplitude.

The decibel scale is expressed as the base 10 logarithm of the ratio between two amplitudes. For instance, a ratio of 2:1 (two times) corresponds to a 6 dB increase, while a ratio of 10:1 (ten times) corresponds to a 20 dB increase. In contrast, a ratio of 1:2 (one half) corresponds to a -6 dB decrease, whereas a ratio of 1:10 (one tenth) corresponds to a -20 dB decrease.

Decibel is non-linear and operates on the logarithmic domain. The `decibel` class is perfectly suitable for dynamics processing (e.g. compressors and limiters and envelopes). Q provides fast `decibel` computations using fast math functions and lookup tables for converting to and from scalars.

== Include

```c++
#include <q/support/decibel.hpp>
```

== Declaration

```c++
struct decibel : _unspecified_base_type_
{
   using base_type = _unspecified_base_type_;
   using base_type::base_type;
};

// Free functions
double               lin_double(decibel db);
constexpr float      lin_float(decibel db);
inline decibel       approx_db(float val);
decibel              lin_to_db(double val);
```

== Expressions

`decibel` is a model of `{Unit}`. In addition to valid expressions for `{Unit}`, `decibel` allows these expressions.

=== Notation

`d`   :: Object of type `decibel`.
`v`   :: Linear floating point value.

=== Constructor

Take note that the `{Unit}` concept already has a constructor from a floating point value that handles direct construction such as:

```c++
auto db = decibel{6.0}; // 6 dB
```

WARNING: Previous versions of the library uses this constructor for linear to decibel conversion,
instead of lin_to_db, which can cause confusion. This version fixes this unintuitive semantics, but this is a breaking change that will silently change the semantics of existing code. We mark this constructor as deprecated, for now, to warn the users upgrading to this version of the library.

If you need to create `decibel` from numeric constants, it is preferrable to use `decibel` literals instead. Example:

```c++
auto db = -6_dB;
```

NOTE: C++ brace initialization may also be used.

| `lin_float(d)`     | Convert `decibel` to a linear value.       | `float`

| `approx_db(v)`     | Faster approximate conversion from
                       a linear value `v` to `decibel`.           | `decibel`
|===

The free function `lin_to_db` can be used to indirectly construct and return a `decibel` object from a linear value. The `lin_to_db` function performs linear to `decibel` conversion. Example:

```c+
auto db = lin_to_db(2.0);  // 6 dB
```

In addition to `lin_to_db`, `approx_db` is another free function that performs linear to `decibel` conversion. It is a faster, but less accurate conversion function from a linear value to `decibel`.

`lin_float` and `lin_double` convert `decibel` to a linear value with `float` and `double` results, respectively.
