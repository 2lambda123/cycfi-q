= duration

include::../../common.adoc[]

Type safe representation of duration: the length of time that something lasts or continues, measured in seconds.

== Include

```c++
#include <q/support/duration.hpp>
```

== Declaration

```c++
struct duration : _unspecified_base_type_
{
   constexpr   duration(double val);
};

// Free functions
constexpr double  as_double(duration d);
constexpr float   as_float(duration d);
```

== Expressions

In addition to valid expressions for {Unit}, `duration` allows these expressions.

=== Notation

`d`      :: Object of type `duration`
`sec`    :: Scalar value in seconds.

=== Constructor

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Expression         |  Semantics

| `duration(sec)`    |  Construction from scaaler `sec` in seconds.
|===

If you need to create `duration` from numeric constants, it is preferrable to use `duration` literals instead. Example:

```c++
auto d = 6_ms;
```

NOTE: C++ brace initialization may also be used.

=== Conversions

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Expression      |  Semantics

| `as_float(d)`   |  Convert duration to a scalar (float) in seconds.
| `as_double(d)`  |  Convert duration to a scalar (double) in seconds.
|===
