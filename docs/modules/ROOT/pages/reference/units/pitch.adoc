:keys: image:keys.svg[alt="440Hz Phase Increments", width=125, role=right]

{keys} `pitch` is determined by its position on the chromatic scale, which is a system of 12 notes that repeat in octaves. The distance between each pitch on the chromatic scale is a semitone, and each pitch represents a specific frequency measured in hertz (Hz).

The `pitch` struct includes construction from `frequency` as well as scalars representing the absolute position in the chromatic scale from the base frequency of `8.1757989156437` Hz, which is an octave below F#0. The constructors support both fixed (integer) positions (e.g. 48 semitones) above the base frequency, and fractional positions (e.g. 120.6 semitones) above the base frequency.

Take note that `pitch` works in a logarithmic scale that is base 2. The frequency range is divided into octaves â€”logarithmic frequency intervals where each octave doubles in frequency. The `pitch` struct includes conversions to and from `frequency`. Q provides fast log2 and pow2 computations using fast math functions.

== Declaration

```c++

=== Expressions

In addition to valid expressions for `NonLinearValue`, `pitch` allows these expressions.

==== Notation

`p`   :: Instance of `pitch`
`i`   :: Instance of `basic_interval<T>`.

==== Arithmetic

`pitch` extends `NonLinearValue` and allows a very restricted set of arithmetic operations with `pitch` and `basic_interval<T>` operands (see {Intervals}).
